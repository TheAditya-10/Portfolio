# Student Lifestyle and Academic Performance Predictor

This project explores how lifestyle signals influence GPA and stress levels using a dataset of 2,000 student records.

## Dataset
- Sleep, study hours, diet, and activity habits.
- Academic scores and stress indicators.
- Cleaned for missing values and outliers.

## Architecture
- Regression models with feature engineering.
- Cross-validation and error analysis.
- Insight dashboards for interpretability.

## Trade-offs
- Self-reported data introduces bias.
- Prioritized interpretability over complex ensembles.
- Short observation windows limited long-term trends.

## Why these choices
- Clear signals are more actionable for educators.
- Regression provides understandable feature impacts.
- Visualization improves stakeholder trust.
